## ⚙️ Development Setup

This project uses `Python` and requires [`pynput`](https://pypi.org/project/pynput/).

git clone https://github.com/ASAnonymousS/keyLogger.git
cd keyLogger
pip install pynput
python3 keylogger.py
```

## 🧪 Testing Your Changes

Before submitting your contribution, ensure the keylogger behaves correctly:

- ✅ Logs characters accurately as words and sentences.
- 🔙 Detects and handles backspaces properly (deletes characters/words as the user does).
- 📄 Generates the log file with a timestamped filename upon typing `exitLogging`.
- 💾 Stores remaining characters or words if no full sentence was formed.
- ⚠️ Doesn’t crash when corner cases are encountered (like empty lists or invalid inputs).
- 📎 Keeps the tool fully offline and portable.

Please test on multiple keyboard layouts and Python versions if possible.
